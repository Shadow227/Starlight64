# Starlight 64 - A Vulkan Based Game Engine:

Starlight 64 is a game engine that I am writing from scratch using minimal API in order to learn more about Vulkan and game engine development in general. While this is a public repo, I will not be accepting outside contribution, however feel free to clone this repo to study it. This engine aims to have graphics simular to the N64 however I am going to push myself as far as I can in this project.


## Currently Done:
- Vulkan API initalized

## TODO:
I will be updating this section as I mark off features that I wish to have in this project.

- Math Library
- Basic 3d Graphics handeling
- Game Objects
- Keyboard support
- UI drawing capibilites
- DEBUG MODE
- Game States
- And much, much more!
